# React Javascript Solana Starter

>>>>>>> 8e59e12 (feat: init)
## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
npx thirdweb create --template cra-javascript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `src/index.js`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for our hooks to work.

on `src/App.js`, you'll find the `useMetamask` hook that we use to connect the user's wallet to MetaMask, `useDisconnect` that we use to disconnect it, and `useAddress` to check the user's wallet address once connected.
